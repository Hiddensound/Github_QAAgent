## QA Summary

# QA Summary
This pull request introduces a GitHub Actions workflow (`jest_runs.yml`) to automate Jest test runs. The configuration allows for the execution of tests on specified events, enhancing the continuous integration process.

## Scenarios
1. **Workflow Triggering on Push**
   - Verify that Jest tests are executed automatically when new code is pushed to the repository.

2. **Workflow Triggering on Pull Request**
   - Ensure that the Jest tests run when a pull request is opened or updated.

3. **Correct Execution of Jest Tests**
   - Confirm that all Jest tests execute as expected and any failing tests are reported correctly.

4. **Notification of Test Results**
   - Check if the test results are reported back in the PR checks and visible in the Actions tab.

5. **Handling of Job Failures**
   - Ensure that the workflow fails appropriately if any of the tests fail.

## Test Cases
### Test Case 1: Verify Workflow Triggers on Push
- **Input:** Push a commit to a branch.
- **Expected Result:** The Jest tests should run automatically as defined in the `jest_runs.yml`.

### Test Case 2: Verify Workflow Triggers on Pull Request
- **Input:** Open a new pull request or update an existing one.
- **Expected Result:** The Jest tests should execute and display logs/results in the PR checks.

### Test Case 3: Validate Execution of Jest Tests
- **Input:** Commit code that includes Jest tests.
- **Expected Result:** All Jest tests should run successfully, and their results should be logged appropriately.

### Test Case 4: Check for Proper Test Result Notification
- **Input:** Complete a test run, whether successful or failed.
- **Expected Result:** Test results should be visible in the pull request as checks and in the actions tab.

### Test Case 5: Ensure Workflow Fails on Test Failure
- **Input:** Commit code that intentionally fails some Jest tests.
- **Expected Result:** The workflow should fail, and the errors from the Jest tests should be reported clearly in the logs and PR checks.
