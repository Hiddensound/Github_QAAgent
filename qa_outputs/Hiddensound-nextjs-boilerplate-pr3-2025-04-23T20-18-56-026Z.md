## QA Summary

# QA Summary

The purpose of this PR is to create a GitHub Actions workflow file named `jest_runs.yml`, which automates the process of running Jest tests in the project repository. This will help ensure that all tests are executed automatically on specified events, improving the CI/CD process.

## Scenarios

1. **Trigger Jest Runs on Push**: Ensure that Jest runs when there is a push to the main or develop branches.
2. **Trigger Jest Runs on Pull Request**: Ensure that Jest runs when a pull request is created or updated, targeting the main or develop branches.
3. **Check for Jest Configuration**: Verify that the Jest configuration is correctly set up in the workflow file.
4. **Output Verification**: Validate the output of the Jest runs in the Actions tab on GitHub.
5. **Run Time Efficiency**: Ensure the workflow runs efficiently and does not exceed expected duration.

## Test Cases

### Test Case 1: Trigger Jest Runs on Push
- **Precondition**: Push a commit to the main or develop branch.
- **Steps**: 
  1. Make a change in the codebase and push to the main branch.
- **Expected Result**: The Jest tests should execute automatically as per the defined workflow.

### Test Case 2: Trigger Jest Runs on Pull Request
- **Precondition**: Create a new branch from develop.
- **Steps**: 
  1. Make changes and create a pull request to merge into the develop branch.
  2. Update the pull request with more changes.
- **Expected Result**: Jest tests should run automatically upon pull request creation and when updates are made.

### Test Case 3: Check for Jest Configuration
- **Precondition**: Review the `jest_runs.yml` file.
- **Steps**:
  1. Validate the presence of necessary configuration for Jest to run.
- **Expected Result**: The configuration should correctly reference Jest and any required environment settings.

### Test Case 4: Output Verification
- **Precondition**: Execute a push or pull request with Jest tests.
- **Steps**: 
  1. Navigate to the Actions tab on GitHub.
  2. Locate the latest run of the Jest workflow.
- **Expected Result**: The output contains details of the test runs, including pass/fail status and error logs if any tests fail.

### Test Case 5: Run Time Efficiency
- **Precondition**: Execute the Jest workflow through a push or pull request.
- **Steps**:
  1. Measure the total time taken for completion of the Jest workflow.
- **Expected Result**: The workflow should complete within a reasonable time frame (specify a threshold based on previous runs, if applicable). 

Make sure all tests are executed and results are validated to ensure that the Jest runs workflow operates as expected.
